## Trading Workflow

The system implements a complete 4-step arbitrage trading workflow:

```
Step 1: Buy
├─ Check if buy exchange supports withdrawal
├─ Click "One-Click Buy"
└─ Execute market buy order

Step 2: Withdraw
├─ Click "One-Click Withdrawal"
├─ Open withdrawal monitoring modal
├─ Click "Start Withdrawal"
└─ Monitor status: pending → processing → completed

Step 3: Monitor Deposit
├─ Click "Start Real-time Monitoring"
├─ Open deposit monitoring modal
└─ Monitor status: monitoring → confirming → completed

Step 4: Sell
├─ Choose selling method:
│  ├─ One-Click Spot Sell
│  └─ One-Click Futures Sell
└─ Execute sell order
```

## Security Features

1. **API Key Protection**
   - All trading functions require API keys (not hardcoded)
   - Placeholder implementation alerts users to configure keys
   - Ready for secure key management integration

2. **Confirmation Dialogs**
   - All critical operations require user confirmation
   - Clear description of what will happen

3. **Capability Checks**
   - Automatic verification before enabling trading actions
   - Prevents operations on unsupported exchanges

4. **CodeQL Security Check**
   - ✅ Passed with 0 vulnerabilities
   - No security issues detected

## Technical Architecture

### API Layer
```
src/api/cex-trading.ts
├─ Exchange-specific implementations
│  ├─ checkBinanceCurrency()
│  ├─ checkOKXCurrency()
│  ├─ checkGateCurrency()
│  └─ checkBybitCurrency()
├─ Generic trading functions
│  ├─ placeMarketBuyOrder()
│  ├─ placeMarketSellOrder()
│  └─ placeFuturesSellOrder()
└─ Monitoring functions
   ├─ getWithdrawalStatus()
   └─ getDepositStatus()
```

### UI Layer
```
src/components/CexArbitrageMonitor.tsx
├─ Main Table with Trading Button
├─ Trading Modal
│  ├─ Arbitrage Info Card
│  ├─ Capability Check Card
│  └─ 4-Step Trading Actions
├─ Withdrawal Monitoring Modal
└─ Deposit Monitoring Modal
```

## Data Flow

```
User Action → Component Handler → API Call → Exchange API
     ↓              ↓                ↓            ↓
  UI Event → State Update → Request → Response
     ↓              ↓                ↓            ↓
 Confirmation → Modal Open → Process → Update UI
```

## Mock Implementation Notes

The current implementation uses mock/placeholder responses for actual trading operations because:

1. **Security**: Real API keys should not be stored in code
2. **Configuration**: Users need to securely configure their own API keys
3. **Testing**: Allows testing UI/UX without real trading risk
4. **Compliance**: Actual trading requires user consent and proper setup

### Functions with Mock Implementation:
- `placeMarketBuyOrder()` - Returns mock order ID
- `placeMarketSellOrder()` - Returns mock order ID
- `placeFuturesSellOrder()` - Returns mock order ID
- `initiateWithdrawal()` - Returns mock withdrawal ID
- `getWithdrawalStatus()` - Returns mock status
- `getDepositStatus()` - Returns empty array
- `getDepositAddress()` - Returns mock address

### Functions with Real Implementation:
- `checkCurrencyCapability()` - Makes real API calls to check deposit/withdrawal support
- Exchange-specific capability checkers for Binance, OKX, Gate.io, Bybit

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: API Integration
1. Implement secure API key management
2. Add real authentication for each exchange
3. Implement actual order placement
4. Add real withdrawal/deposit operations

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Automatic arbitrage execution
2. Multi-pair simultaneous trading
3. Risk management system
4. Profit/loss tracking
